# JobSim - Job Execution Simulation

A Python-based job execution simulation system that models and simulates various job scheduling and execution scenarios.

## Overview

JobSim is designed to simulate job execution environments, allowing developers and system administrators to test and analyze different job scheduling strategies, resource allocation policies, and execution patterns before implementing them in production systems.

## Features

- **Job Simulation**: Simulate various types of jobs with different resource requirements
- **Scheduling Algorithms**: Test different job scheduling strategies (FIFO, Priority-based, Round Robin, etc.)
- **Resource Management**: Simulate CPU, memory, and I/O resource allocation
- **Performance Analysis**: Analyze job execution times, resource utilization, and system throughput
- **Configurable Scenarios**: Create custom job execution scenarios for testing

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd jobsim
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies (when requirements.txt is available):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.jobsim import JobSimulator

# Create a simulator instance
simulator = JobSimulator()

# Add jobs to the simulation
simulator.add_job(job_id="job1", priority=1, resources={"cpu": 2, "memory": 4})
simulator.add_job(job_id="job2", priority=2, resources={"cpu": 1, "memory": 2})

# Run the simulation
results = simulator.run()
```

### Configuration Examples

```python
# Configure simulation parameters
config = {
    "scheduling_algorithm": "priority",
    "resource_limits": {"cpu": 8, "memory": 16},
    "time_quantum": 100,
    "max_jobs": 100
}

simulator = JobSimulator(config)
```

## Development

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # When available
   ```

2. Run tests:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/
   ```

3. Run linting:
   ```bash
   flake8 src/
   ```

### Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature-name`
3. Make your changes
4. Add tests for new functionality
5. Run the test suite
6. Submit a pull request

## Architecture

The simulation system is built around several core components:

- **Job**: Represents a single job with resource requirements and execution parameters
- **Scheduler**: Manages job queuing and execution order
- **Resource Manager**: Handles resource allocation and deallocation
- **Simulation Engine**: Coordinates the overall simulation process
- **Metrics Collector**: Gathers performance and resource utilization data

## Configuration

JobSim can be configured through:

- Configuration files (JSON/YAML)
- Environment variables
- Programmatic configuration
- Command-line arguments

## Examples

### Simple Job Simulation

```python
from src.jobsim import JobSimulator, Job

# Create jobs
job1 = Job(id="web_server", priority=1, cpu_cores=2, memory_gb=4)
job2 = Job(id="database", priority=2, cpu_cores=4, memory_gb=8)

# Run simulation
simulator = JobSimulator()
simulator.add_job(job1)
simulator.add_job(job2)

results = simulator.run()
print(f"Total execution time: {results.total_time}")
print(f"Resource utilization: {results.resource_utilization}")
```

### Batch Job Processing

```python
# Simulate batch processing of multiple jobs
batch_jobs = [
    Job(id=f"batch_{i}", priority=3, cpu_cores=1, memory_gb=2)
    for i in range(10)
]

simulator = JobSimulator(scheduling_algorithm="batch")
for job in batch_jobs:
    simulator.add_job(job)

results = simulator.run()
```

## Testing

Run the test suite to ensure everything works correctly:

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=src

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_jobsim.py
```

## Performance

JobSim is designed to handle:
- Up to 10,000 concurrent jobs
- Multiple resource types (CPU, Memory, I/O, GPU)
- Various scheduling algorithms
- Real-time simulation updates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Memory Issues**: Reduce the number of concurrent jobs or resource limits
2. **Performance**: Use appropriate scheduling algorithms for your use case
3. **Configuration**: Check configuration file syntax and parameter values
